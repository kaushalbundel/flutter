# Widgets on Flutter

- The flutter app consists of widgets created in the form of a widget tree. 

- The app also has packages, from where we could do imports and extend the code mentioned in the package.

- extends keyword: inherits the properties of the class
- There can be two types of arguments
-- Named Argument and positional argument:  So far Positional arguments have been used while practicing. Named Arguments are used by calling the name of the argument instead of a position
